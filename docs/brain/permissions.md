# Permissions

> **Admin** have all permissions.

> Beware that certain permissions may required some other to be fully accomplished. (Allowing a user to EDIT_SKILL_CODE without allowing him to SEE_SKILL_CODE is not very convenient.)

> TUHAT = The User Has Access To.

> Suffix `_ANY` to permissions with `*` to remove the "The User Has Access To" condition.
